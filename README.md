 ## About Me <br/>
    I am a Single Mom to an amazing 5 year old Daughter who I homeschool. 
    I am currently taking a bootcamp for Software Engineering and am really liking the front end
    portion of it. If I were to have to make a choice now, I would say I would like to go into Front End Engineering,
    which makes sense to me because I have always been very artsy and loved design. In my free time I love to travel,
    spend time outdoors, and with friends and family. I am looking forward to learning more technologies!
